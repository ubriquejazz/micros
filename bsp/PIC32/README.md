The PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit II provides the easiest and lowest-cost method to experience 10/100 Ethernet development with PIC32 microcontrollers. Combined with Microchip’s free TCP/IP software, this kit gets your project running quickly. The PIC32 microcontroller has an available CAN 2 0b peripheral and USB host/device/OTG. This starter kit features a socket that can accommodate various 10/100 Ethernet transceiver (RJ-45) PHY Daughter Boards for prototyping and development.

## HelvePic32 Development Board

The HelvePic32 has the size 42x72 mm, which is a standard module size. All parts are through hole as demonstrated in this 3D simulation. It can be soldered within an hour by an inexperienced new-comer to electronics.

The board is programmed using MPIDE, similar to the Arduino IDE and the Arduino code can be used in 99% of the cases.
